This project aims at assisting the hearing impaired by providing innovative solutions to the numerous challenges experienced by them. These can be someone at the door, someone forcibly entering into the house or an alarm going off. Since about 5 percent of the world population experience hearing loss, it is critical to develop a home security system dedicated to them. The proposed device provides solutions to all problems the hearing impaired encounter. Home security is made accessible to the Deaf and hearing impaired by including features that are essential and distinct to them. Hence, it can immensely improve the quality of life of the hearing impaired. The system provides surveillance using the Raspberry Pi which can be monitored from an Android application. A knock at the door, a doorbell press, smoke, gas, fire, Carbon Monoxide(CO) and water levels are monitored using the vibration, button, MQ2, MQ6, Flame, MQ7 and water level sensors, following which an alert is sent in case of unfavorable situations. The system also checks constantly for intruders using an ultrasonic sensor and an alert is sent in case of the same. In addition to this, a panic button that sends an SMS is provided to assist the user in case of an emergency. The proposed system can overcome the shortcomings of previous systems by providing unique and efficient solutions to the prevalent and severe issues faced by the hearing impaired.
